# agit — git for running agents

An AI coding session is trapped: one terminal, one machine, a proprietary log
format, one pair of eyes. When it ends you're left with changed files and a
scrollback buffer.

agit turns the session itself into an open artifact. It imports a runtime's
native log into an append-only, hash-chained JSONL event log — and every
feature is a view over that log. agit does not build an agent; it sits above
every agent, the way git sits above every editor.

*(a synthetic fixture session — real ones look the same, only longer)*

agit is not an observability platform. Those ask you to instrument your
agents with an SDK, and they show you what that instrumentation captured.
agit reads the logs your runtime already wrote, on your own machine, with
nothing to adopt in advance. And because every event carries content
hashes, agit can prove when a log is incomplete rather than quietly
presenting a partial picture as the whole story.

```
npm install -g agitsh
```

Or, for contributors, from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/agitHQ/agit && cd agit
npm ci && npm run build && npm link   # `agit` is now on your PATH
```

## What works today

- **`agit import <session | bundle>`** — ingest a native session into
  `.agit/sessions/<id>/events.jsonl`, or **adopt** an agit log someone sent
  you (a `pr` bundle, a downloaded share log) — auto-detected, verified
  before it is stored, and kept byte for byte so the sender's hashes still
  check out. Two adapters for native logs, also auto-detected:
  **Claude Code** (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<uuid>.jsonl`) and
  **Codex CLI** (`~/.codex/sessions/<y>/<m>/<d>/rollout-*.jsonl`) — the
  same event log, the same verbs, whichever agent produced the session.
  `agit import --all` finds every session those runtimes have written on
  this machine (`~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex/sessions`,
  `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions`) and imports what is new; `--latest`
  takes just the most recent one; `--since 7d` bounds the scan. A directory
  listing plus the ordinary import — no daemon, no hooks — and last month's
  sessions are found the same way as today's.
  Deterministic: the same input always produces byte-identical output.
  Credential-looking strings are redacted on the way in (see
  [SPEC.md section 8](SPEC.md) for exactly what is and isn't caught).
  `--no-redact` stores a session verbatim when redaction would mangle it;
  `share`, `pr` and `export-html` then refuse that session until you pass
  `--allow-unredacted`, and re-importing without the flag puts redaction back.
- **`agit ls`** — list imported sessions: start, duration, events, files
  touched, and tags. Ids show as the shortest prefix still unique in the
  store. Narrow with `--tag`, `--runtime` or `--project`, order with
  `--sort started|events|files|id`.
- **`agit tag <id> <tag>` / `agit note <id> "<text>"`** — what you thought
  about a session afterwards. Both live in a sidecar (`notes.json`) beside
  the log and never enter the chain: the chain is what the runtime did, and a
  tag changes. `agit verify` neither sees nor is affected by them.
- **`agit rm <id>`** and **`agit gc --older-than 90d [--keep-tagged]`** —
  retention. Both confirm before deleting, and refuse outright when there is
  no terminal to ask unless `--yes` is passed. `rm` warns first that any fork
  of the session loses its merge base, since `agit merge` reconstructs that
  from the log — it cannot know whether such a fork exists, since forks live
  wherever `--out` put them with no registry to consult, and says so rather
  than guessing.
- **`agit show <id>`** — one-session summary: model, tools, token totals,
  per-file diffstat. `--by-model` splits it: what each model cost and how
  many files its edits touched. Tokens are exact; file attribution credits
  an edit to the model named by the nearest preceding event, and says so.
- **`agit stats`** — store-wide usage across every session and runtime:
  tokens, cache reads and writes, API calls, sessions and files touched,
  grouped `--by day|model|runtime|project` and narrowed with `--since`.
  No prices are built in — they change, they differ per account, and a stale
  number that looks authoritative is worse than none. Pass your own rate
  table to get money:

  ```json
  { "currency": "USD", "per": 1000000,
    "models": { "claude-opus-5": { "input": 15, "output": 75,
                                   "cacheRead": 1.5, "cacheWrite": 18.75 } } }
  ```

  `agit stats --by model --price rates.json`. A model missing from the table
  is reported as unpriced, never costed at zero, and a group whose runtime
  records no cost events at all says so rather than showing a row of zeros.
  A fold over the `cost` events each session already carries, so it needs no
  new data, and it says how many sessions it could not read rather than
  quietly leaving them out. `--json` for scripts.
- **`agit grep <pattern>`** — search every imported session at once:
  "which session touched auth.py" (`--path`), "where did I run pytest"
  (`--type tool.call`). Matches the same one-line rendering `replay
  --timeline` prints, so what you search is what you saw, and outputs one
  flat row per hit for piping onward.
- **`agit verify <id>`** — validate the hash chain; reports the first broken
  link, and detects truncation via `meta.json`.
- **`agit blame <file>`** and **`agit why <file>:<line>`** — from a line of
  code back to the session and event that wrote it, and from there back to
  the prompt that asked for it. Verifiable rather than merely recorded: the
  line traces to a hash-chained event, and every replayed step had to
  reproduce its own content hash. It inherits the §5.7 limit and says so —
  lines a shell command wrote read `(no structured edit)`, and where a file
  changed outside structured edits, blame stops at that point and names it
  instead of guessing past it. **`agit link`** prints the
  `Agit-Session: <id>@<seq> <hash>` trailer to anchor a commit to a session.
- **Redaction controls** — the built-in patterns (SPEC §8) can be extended
  and narrowed per project via `.agit/redact.json` (or `--redact-patterns`):

  ```json
  { "patterns": [{ "label": "acme-token", "regex": "acme_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}" }],
    "allow": ["sk-ant-EXAMPLE00000000000000", { "regex": "^sk-ant-example-" }] }
  ```

  Custom patterns catch internal token formats the built-ins cannot know
  about; the allowlist keeps documented example keys and test fixtures from
  being rewritten on import. `agit redact --check <log>` is a dry run: it
  prints what would be redacted, by event type and payload path, with every
  sample masked, then re-scans the redacted result so the count can never
  under-report. `--no-redact` stores a log exactly as the runtime wrote it —
  for local-only stores; `share` and `pr` refuse such a session unless
  `--allow-unredacted` is passed. Redaction still happens once, before
  hashing, at import: the chain never holds both versions of a string. A
  live `share` re-converts from the native log rather than reading the
  store, and applies the same config, so what a viewer sees is redacted by
  the same rules the store was.
- **`agit replay <id>`** — step through events (`n`/`p`/`g N`), inspect any
  event, and show cumulative file state at any point (`s`, or `--at N
  --state` non-interactively). `--at N` jumps straight to event N;
  `--timeline` prints the whole session one line per event.
- **`agit fork <id> --at N`** — branch a session at event N. The file tree
  is reconstructed from the log and **verified**: every replayed diff must
  reproduce its event's content hash, broken chains recover from
  runtime-recorded pre-edit content where it exists, and whatever cannot be
  verified is listed instead of written. Context is honestly lossy: the
  fork gets `SEED.md`, a deterministic mechanical summary (provenance,
  the task, last exchanges, file state) — not a transplant of the agent's
  mind. `fork.json` records the source session and fork-point hash, so
  provenance is checkable with `agit verify`.
- **`agit diff <a> <b>`** — what two sessions did differently: files each
  side touched, which ones converged on identical content, which diverged
  (with both hashes), and the work each spent getting there. `agit diff
  <fork-dir>` compares a fork against the parent it came from, starting at
  the fork point recorded in `fork.json`. Comparison is by reconstructed
  content, so it inherits replay's blind spot and says so.
- **`agit merge <fork-dir>` — bring a fork's files back: ordinary git
  three-way merge per file with the fork point as base (`git merge-file`
  does the merging). Trivial cases fast-forward, real conflicts get
  standard markers and a nonzero exit, and the merge — outcomes plus your
  `--summary` of what the fork learned — is recorded in the fork's
  `merge.json`. Not a merge of two minds; file-level, as promised.
- **`agit pr <id>`** — hand a session to a colleague as a directory: the
  full event log, `meta.json`, the reconstructed hash-verified tree,
  `SEED.md` context, and provenance. They run `agit import` on the
  directory and get a session they can replay, fork and verify like any
  other — working context, not a read-only transcript.
- **`agit share <id | native.jsonl>`** — share a session through a relay,
  **live while the agent is still running**: the CLI tails the native log
  and streams events; teammates watch in a browser (timeline, diffs, token
  meter) and can send messages that land in your terminal. **Watching is
  read-only by default**: viewer messages reach the human at the keyboard,
  never the agent; `--steer` is the opt-in that changes that, below. A
  completed live stream is byte-identical to a full
  import — viewers can download `events.jsonl` and `agit verify` what they
  watched. If the sharing CLI dies, `agit share --resume <share-id>`
  reattaches to the same link and pushes only the missing tail. Links
  expire (24h default) and sharing is opt-in per session, always. A stored
  session whose chain does not verify is refused — `share`, `export`, `fork`
  and `pr` all name the failing event rather than publishing it.
- **`agit share <native.jsonl> --steer`** — let teammates redirect the agent,
  not just watch it. The share prints a **steer key** alongside the link; a
  viewer who enters it (on the page, or from a terminal with
  `agit steer <link> "<text>" --steer-key K`) sends a message *to the agent*
  instead of only to your terminal. Nothing is injected mid-run and nothing
  is typed on your behalf: the message is queued under `.agit/steer/`, and
  **Claude Code's own hooks hand it over at the next turn boundary** —
  `Stop`, so the agent picks it up instead of stopping, and
  `UserPromptSubmit`, so it rides along with your next prompt if the agent
  was idle. Both are the documented `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`
  channel, subject to Claude Code's own loop guard (eight continuations in
  a row, then it stops regardless). One-time setup per project:
  `agit hook --config` prints the two-line `settings.json` fragment that
  runs `agit hook` at those events; it prints nothing unless a live share
  has queued something. Every steered message is shown in the sharing
  terminal first, attributed, and a message with a wrong key is shown too —
  labelled, and delivered to no one. The key never reaches other viewers;
  the relay forwards it to the sharer alone, who is the only party that can
  check it. Only Claude Code is wired, because only Claude Code documents a
  turn-boundary hook; `--steer` on a Codex or OpenClaw session is refused
  with that reason rather than promising a channel that does not exist.
- **`agit relay`** — the self-hosted relay behind `share`: in-memory only,
  loopback by default, nothing persisted. [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)
  documents the (v0, unstable) wire protocol.
- **`agit push <id>` / `agit pull <link>`** — a remote is just a relay
  someone else runs. `push` publishes a verified session and exits, printing
  a link; `pull` adopts it somewhere else over HTTP. Pulling is the same code
  path as adopting a `pr` bundle, so **the relay is never trusted**: the chain
  is verified before anything is stored, the events land byte for byte with
  the hashes the origin published, and a relay that alters a single byte
  serves a log that fails verification. Pushing twice reuses the same link
  unless you pass `--force`, and pushing a session that does not verify is
  refused, like every other publishing verb.

  `agit relay --store <dir>` gives the relay a disk, so a restart keeps every
  link working instead of dropping it — two flat files per share, no database
  and no dependency. Without it the relay is memory-only, which is still the
  default. **That directory holds writer tokens**, so treat it as a credential
  store; it is created `0700` with `0600` files, and on Windows those modes
  are advisory. `agit share --static --detach` prints the link and exits, for
  CI and scripts that want a URL rather than a process.
- **`agit export <id> --otel | --atif`** — feed the tools you already run,
  with a log that verifies. `--otel` emits OTLP/JSON spans following the
  OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions: an `invoke_agent` root, `chat`
  children per model call with token counts, `execute_tool` children per tool.
  `--atif` emits a Harbor Agent Trajectory Interchange Format document
  (ATIF-v1.8), which Harbor uses for evals and fine-tuning and which its
  OpenHands adapter converts OpenHands event logs into. Both are folds over
  events already stored; neither changes SPEC.

  **Span ids are the leading bytes of the event hash they came from**, so a
  trace in Grafana points back at a specific line of a log you can `agit
  verify`; the full hash rides along as an attribute, because 8 bytes is a
  convenience and not a proof. Output is deterministic — no random ids, no
  wall clock — and an unverified session is refused, since feeding an eval
  from a log agit cannot vouch for is how a verified pipeline quietly stops
  being one. The GenAI conventions are at Development stability and have
  never cut a release, so the emitted schema URL ends in `-dev` and this will
  need updating; `file.diff` has no home in either schema, so edits ride in
  each format's own extension field with the SPEC §5.7 lower bound stated
  beside them.
- **`agit sign <id> --key <file>`** — bind a head to a key. The chain proves
  a log was not modified after it was chained; it says nothing about *who*
  chained it, because anyone can rebuild a perfectly valid chain over edited
  content and a matching head. A signature is the missing half, and `verify`
  catches exactly that forgery:

  ```
  ok: 31 events, chain intact, matches meta.json head
  SIGNATURE DOES NOT MATCH (SHA256:+++sbwFo…): does not match this head
  ```

  Ed25519, reading the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` you already have or any PKCS#8
  PEM. Signatures live in `meta.json`, never in the chain, so a session can
  be signed after import and by more than one person without rewriting an
  event — and they travel in `pr` bundles, so the recipient can check them.
  Encrypted keys are refused rather than prompted for; agit never handles a
  passphrase. **What it does not prove: when.** The timestamp is signed, so
  it cannot be edited afterwards, but it is still a time the signer chose.
  Only a third-party RFC 3161 time-stamp makes that evidence, and agit does
  not issue one. [SPEC §12](SPEC.md) documents the signed payload so other
  implementations can verify without agit.
- **`agit mcp`** — serve the store to an agent over MCP, so the agent can
  ask its own verified history "have I solved this before?" instead of that
  being something only a human can do with `grep`. Six read-only tools:
  `agit_list`, `agit_grep`, `agit_show`, `agit_replay`, `agit_diff` and
  `agit_verify`. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini and Cline all speak MCP,
  so one server covers every runtime agit imports from. Point a client at it:

  ```json
  { "mcpServers": { "agit": { "command": "agit", "args": ["mcp", "--dir", "/path/to/project"] } } }
  ```

  **Read-only by design.** There is no tool that writes, and nothing arriving
  over this transport reaches `import`, `tag`, `rm` or the redaction config.
  Every answer carries whether that session's chain verifies, and
  `agit_verify` asks directly, so an agent knows what it is trusting. Session
  logs are untrusted input, so each payload is labelled as recorded data
  rather than direction — a label, not a sandbox, and worth the same
  scepticism as redaction.

**`--json`** on `ls`, `show`, `show --by-model`, `verify`, `grep`, `diff`
and `export` emits the structures agit already builds, so a script reads
the same numbers the table renders — full ids, ISO timestamps, real
integers. `grep --json` is one object per line (NDJSON); everything else
is one document. Errors stay on stderr, so a pipe into `jq` is always clean.

Session ids accept unique prefixes, git-style. The inspection verbs are
fully local: no server, no network calls, no telemetry. Only `share` talks
to a relay — one you run.

## The format

[SPEC.md](SPEC.md) is the most important artifact in this repo. Nine event
types (`session.start`, `session.end`, `message.user`, `message.assistant`,
`tool.call`, `tool.result`, `file.diff`, `file.delete`, `cost`), each
carrying a canonical
SHA-256 hash and the hash of the previous event. Tamper-evidence, stable fork
points, and independent verification of what an agent claims it did — all
fall out of that chain.

## What does not work yet

Said plainly:

- **Six adapters, with different limits.** Claude Code is the reference;
  Codex is mapped from its own structured edit records. OpenClaw is mapped
  from the `apply_patch` text it records, replayed with OpenClaw's own
  matching rules. OpenCode is mapped from session turns, thoughts, and tool
  invocations. ATIF is a standard rather than a runtime, and Cline's SDK
  format is a published contract; neither carries file content agit can
  hash — see below.
- **Codex updates have a verification window.** Codex records a file's full
  content when it *creates* one, but only a diff when it *updates* one — so
  agit can verify an update only while it already holds that file's content
  from earlier in the same session. An edit to a file that predates the
  session is skipped and counted, never hashed on a guess — unless you supply
  the base yourself: `agit import <log> --base <git-ref | directory>` seeds
  the pre-session content from the commit the session started from, or a copy
  of the tree. It is checked, not trusted: the runtime's own diff still has to
  apply to it and the result still has to hash, so a wrong base skips exactly
  as no base does. Only files the runtime actually edited are consulted;
  nothing else enters the log, and `meta.json` records which base was used.
- **OpenClaw has the same window**: `apply_patch` records the patch, not
  the file, so an update is verifiable only for a file the session created.
- **Codex renames are recorded as a delete plus a create** — schema v2 gives
  a rename an honest encoding, so the log says what the filesystem saw: the
  old path gone, the new one created with the updated content. A rename
  whose base predates the session is still skipped and counted, because
  neither path has content agit could hash. Deletions are recorded
  (`file.delete`) whenever Codex logged the file's content.
- **Codex reasoning arrives encrypted** and is dropped, counted.
- **`file.diff` coverage is partial.** Diffs come from structured edit tools
  (`Edit`/`Write`). Files changed through shell commands leave no diff event;
  file state from replay is a lower bound on what changed. Fork trees
  inherit this blind spot: a file the log never structurally edited is
  absent from the tree entirely, and a file deleted by a shell command
  still appears at its last logged content — only a structured deletion
  (`file.delete`) removes it.
- **No message injection mid-run, and steering is Claude Code only.**
  Sharing is watch-only unless the sharer passes `--steer`, and even then a
  message is never fed into a running turn: it waits for the runtime's own
  turn boundary (Claude Code's `Stop` / `UserPromptSubmit` hooks) and is
  delivered through the documented `additionalContext` channel, which the
  agent weighs like any other context — a teammate's request, not a command
  from the keyboard. Codex, OpenClaw, Cline and ATIF sessions have no
  documented equivalent, so `--steer` refuses them; a runtime that gains one
  gets wired the same way, per adapter, opt-in.
- **The relay speaks TLS only when you give it a certificate.**
  `agit relay --cert <pem> --key <pem>` serves HTTPS; otherwise it is plain
  HTTP on loopback, and binding beyond loopback without TLS is refused unless
  `--insecure` is passed. A tunnel or TLS-terminating proxy remains a
  perfectly good alternative (PROTOCOL.md).
- **Merge is file-level.** Three-way content *content* merge only, and a
  rename is two files. It uses `git merge-file` when git is on PATH and a
  built-in three-way merge otherwise (`--no-git` forces the built-in one);
  git is preferred because its results are what everyone's expectations are
  calibrated against, and the two are pinned to each other by differential
  tests. A file simply absent from a fork tree counts as untouched rather
  than deleted, because the tree records only what the log could reconstruct
  — but `agit merge --session <id>` reads the fork's own imported session and
  honours the `file.delete` events it recorded after the fork point, deleting
  only where the removed content matches both the fork point and what the
  target holds today. Fork and `pr` context seeding is a summary by design;
  you cannot inject history into a running agent.
- **An ATIF import has no file history.** `agit import <trajectory.json>`
  reads Harbor's Agent Trajectory Interchange Format, so anything emitting
  ATIF can be verified, replayed, searched and shared. But ATIF has no
  file-edit construct — a write is an ordinary tool call whose result is
  prose — so no `file.diff` can be emitted over content the document does not
  hold. `blame`, `why`, `fork`, `merge` and `diff` therefore have nothing to
  work with on such a session; everything else does. What the import cannot
  carry is counted and named rather than passed over, including edits that
  agit itself exported as hashes.
- **A Cline SDK import has no file history either, for a sharper reason.**
  `agit import <id>.messages.json` reads the format new Cline sessions land
  in from 4.0 (`~/.cline/data/sessions/`), which Cline documents as "the
  canonical replay/export artifact" for exactly this purpose. The `editor`
  tool's create path converts LF to CRLF when, and only when, the operating
  system Cline ran on is Windows — and the log does not record which OS that
  was. A hash over the recorded content would be right on Linux and wrong on
  Windows, which is a hash agit did not compute over bytes it holds, so none
  is emitted. Edit results carry only a diff the runtime truncates at 200
  lines. Every `editor` and `apply_patch` call is counted in the import report
  as an edit agit cannot verify. The older VS Code globalStorage layout is
  undocumented and unversioned and is deliberately not read.
- **A signature does not prove when, and does not prove truth.**
  `agit sign` binds a head to a key, which is what the chain alone could
  never do. The timestamp inside it is signed, so it cannot be edited
  afterwards, but it is still the signer's own claim — turning that into
  evidence needs a third-party RFC 3161 time-stamp, which agit does not
  issue. And a signature over a log full of false statements is a signed log
  full of false statements: it binds an identity to bytes, nothing more.
- **The MCP server labels untrusted content; it does not sandbox it.**
  `agit mcp` hands recorded session text to a model, and that text can
  contain anything the agent saw, including material written to read as
  instructions. Every payload is framed as recorded data in a field no
  session can shadow, which is a label of the same kind as redaction and
  deserves the same scepticism.
- **The OpenTelemetry export tracks a moving target.** The GenAI semantic
  conventions are at Development stability, moved repositories during 2026,
  and have never cut a release — so `--otel` emits the only schema URL that
  exists, which ends in `-dev`, and will need updating as the conventions
  settle.
- **Redaction is a seatbelt, not a guarantee.** Session logs contain whatever
  the agent saw. Before sharing one anywhere, read it.

## Security posture

Session logs are untrusted input: they may contain adversarial content and
are never executed, only displayed — the share page builds its DOM from
`textContent` exclusively and ships a CSP that forbids external resources.
Known credential patterns are redacted before events leave your machine
(at import and during live shares alike) and counted in `meta.json`. Share
links are unguessable 128-bit capabilities with TTLs; the relay holds
everything in memory, binds loopback by default, and persists nothing. A
steer key is a second, separate capability: the link lets someone read, the
key lets them queue a message for the agent, and the relay never learns
whether a key was right — only the sharer holds it. Never commit real
session logs to this repo — tests run against synthetic fixtures.

## Development

Node 20+, TypeScript, ESM, zero runtime dependencies.

```
npm install
npm run build   # tsc -> dist/
npm test        # vitest
```

Conventional Commits, small and focused. If a real session breaks an adapter,
fix the adapter, not the fixture. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the
full onboarding path — repo map, adapter-writing guide, and the rules that
are not suggestions. CI runs build + tests on Linux and Windows, Node 20/22.
